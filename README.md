This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In the project directory, you can run:
Rules to check Leap Year 
1.  All years divisible by 400 ARE leap years,
2.  All years divisible by 100 but not by 400 are NOT leap years
3.  All years divisible by 4 but not by 100 ARE leap years,
4.  All years not divisible by 4 are NOT leap years.
